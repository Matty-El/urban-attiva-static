# Urban Paws Website

![Urban Paws Website](readme-files/urban-paws-website-presented.png)

Working with the company director, this website has been developed as the first iteration for a new startup company Urban Paws. The website provides potential customers with an overview of the company and information in relation to products that have been developed and products that are for sale via links to listings on Amazon.co.uk.

The client requested a simple, attractive and modern website that is responsive and easy to navigate, allows potential customers to sign up for email updates on company news, provides links to the company social media accounts and links to enable the customer to purchase products.

The site was developed using knowledge gained from the Code Institute HTML, CSS and User Centric Frontend Development modules.

The Urban Paws website has been structured to provide a simple and easy to navigate website. There are four pages - Home, Shop Dog, Shop Cat and About Us and a Contact form so that users can contact the company to provide comments, make enquiries and / or sign up to the Urban Paws newsletter.

The website has the following key elements:

-   A simple navigation menu that enables the users to easily navigate between the website pages.
-   Links to social media sites so that users can follow the company on social media.
-   Call to action buttons are present on the Home page to encourage the users to click through to the contact form and shop pages.
-   The shop pages contain the product listings along with size guides and a link to enable the customers to purchase the   products via Amazon.co.uk.
-   The contact menu item provides a form which the users can populate to provide comments, make enquiries and / or sign up to the Urban Paws newsletter.

### Skeleton

#### Wireframes

The wireframes were developed using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

-   Small device [wireframes](design/urban-paws-wireframes-small-device-v1.pdf).
-   Medium device [wireframes](design/urban-paws-wireframes-medium-device-v1.pdf).
-   Large device [wireframes](design/urban-paws-wireframes-large-device-v1.pdf).

After the initial design was finalised the following changes were agreed and made:

-   The Contact Us page was replaced with a contact form modal as this was considered a cleaner implementation of the form.
-   The main Shop page was removed to simplify the website design and layout.
-   An About Us page was added to include the team member profiles.
-   As shopping basket functionality will be a future development a decision was made to simplify the product card layout and provide a link to Amazon.co.uk.

### Surface

Working with the client an [Urban Paws Branding Template](design/urban-paws-branding-template.pdf) has been developed to ensure a strong and consistent brand image has been applied to the Urban Paws website.

#### Branding

An Urban Paws logo has been developed and is displayed prominently on the website pages.

#### Typography
